# Video Control
Controlling (youtube) tutorial video through step-by-step segments 

# Framework
Svelte + Flask

# Functions

* pause, play, rewind 1s
* next step - plays next step, stops at the end
* prev step - goes back to previous step, stops at the end

By integrating external signaling, video can be continued by confirming a step has been completed (for example through detection).
I am using an example of a crochet tutorial to develop this tool.
